        <p>Fargus is a kleptomaniac gnome illusionist sorcerer, a small, wiry creature with a mischievous grin. They are always on the lookout for a good opportunity to steal something, and they are very adept at using their illusions to create confusion and distraction. Fargus is also quite charming and have a silver tongue, which they use to their advantage in negotiations. They are fiercely independent and have a strong desire to be in control of their own lives. They are also very impatient and have a short temper. They are easily bored and crave excitement and adventure. They have a strong bond with their familiar, which they see as a loyal companion and confidante. They also have a deep connection to the magic of illusion and see it as a tool to be used for their own amusement and gain. Fargusâ€™ greatest flaw is their compulsive need to steal, which often gets them into trouble. Additionally, their impulsiveness and lack of foresight often leads them into dangerous situations. They are usually dressed in brightly-colored clothes and wear a lot of jewelry, which they have collected from their various heists. They have a small pouch full of Illusion Dust, which they use to create their illusions. Fargus was born into a family of thieves and grew up learning the tricks of the trade. However, they quickly surpassed their parents and siblings in both skill and ingenuity. They eventually left home to pursue their own goals and have been honing their skills ever since.</p>
