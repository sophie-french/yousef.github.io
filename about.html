    <p>I'm Yousef, a 24 year old Janitor from Ontario who now lives in Tokyo. I love Dungeons and Dragons, beer, and my fiancee Maggie. I came to Tokyo because I wanted to experience something different and explore the world. I'm so glad I did, because I've fallen in love with this city. It's a bustling, vibrant place that is always full of new and exciting things to do. I can't imagine living anywhere else now. The RPG scene here is amazing, and I've made some great friends through playing D&D. I'm also really into craft beer, and there are so many great breweries here to try. And of course, Maggie is the best part of my life. We met here in Tokyo and bonded over our love of all things nerdy. We're getting married next year, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.</p>

    <h3>fun facts <img src="Images/rat.gif"></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I once went on a date with a robot. It was part of a promotion for a new dating app, and it was actually really fun. I would definitely do it again.</li>
        <li>I have an identical twin brother. People always think we're the same person, but we're actually quite different. He's a doctor and I'm a janitor, so I think that says it all.</li>
        <li>I once ate an entire head of cabbage in one sitting. It was part of a bet, and I regret nothing.</li>
        <li>I'm actually allergic to cats, but I love them anyway. I've always wanted to have a pet cat, but it's just not possible for me. Maybe someday I'll find an allergy medication that will allow me to have a cat of my own.</li>
        <li>I can speak three languages: English, Japanese, and Arabic. I learned Japanese so that I could better communicate with my co-workers, and it's been really helpful. I also love learning new languages, and I'm currently studying Korean.</li>
        <li> I'm a huge Lord of the Rings nerd. I've read all the books and seen all the movies multiple times. I even have a tattoo of the One Ring on my finger.</li>
        <li>I once played D&D with Patrick Stewart. It was at a con in London and he was so nice. We chatted for a bit about our love of the game and then went our separate ways. It was an amazing experience, and I'll never forget it.</li>
        <li>I know all the lyrics to every Taylor Swift song. Don't judge me, her songs are catchy.</li>
        <li>I used to be a professional clown. I would perform at birthday parties and other events. It was a lot of fun, but I gave it up when I moved to Tokyo.</li>
