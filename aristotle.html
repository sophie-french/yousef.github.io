        <p>Aristotle is a Human Wizard who is studied in the Arcane Arts. He is often described as being wise beyond his years and is known for his diplomacy. He believes in the value of knowledge and understanding, and always looks to find the root of the problem before taking any action.</p>
        <p>Aristotle is tall and thin, with pale skin and dark hair. He is usually seen in robes, with his trusty spellbook by his side. He hails from a small village in the kingdom of Eldoria, where he was born to a family of farmers. When he was sixteen, he was visited by a travelling wizard who saw potential in the young man and took him under his wing. Aristotle soon proved to be a natural at magic, and he soon left his home behind to embark on a journey of discovery.</p>
        <p>He has since travelled all over the world, learning everything he can about magic and its many applications. He also takes great interest in the natural world, and often can be found studying plants and animals. He has a calming presence and a way with words, which has served him well in his travels. He is currently on a quest to find a lost city of magical knowledge, which he is confident he will find someday.</p>
